                    <p>We have housing of all kinds, and a group rate for most of it. Don't delay; things will fill up! We would love to have as many guests as possible in the Village so we’re all together.<p>

                    <p>The links below will let you see pics, but <span class="italics">please do not reserve online</span>! The system will not always show you all vacancies or allow you to choose the Village. Read carefully below, then call one of the two numbers</p>

                    <p>Many options have kitchens, multiple bedrooms and baths,  and livings rooms (some with pull-outs). The best way to save is by buddying up!</p>

                    <h2>What about the Ritz?</h2>
                    <p>Really, you still want to talk about lodging? We do not have a group rate at the Ritz, but you are welcome to stay there and soak your feet in champagne every night. You will be able to reach the Village by gondola until 10 pm.</p>

                    <h2>Why am I so drunk?</h2>
                    <p>It’s the altitude. Remember to drink plenty of water and go easy on the sauce. For more information, talk to our Health and Substances Education Specialist, Martha Reynolds.</p>

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <h2>Should I pack anything special?</h2>
                    <p>Yes! Bring snow gear, skis, boards, mittens and a reindeer sleigh. Also a bathing suit for the hot tub. The ceremony will be outside, so please bundle up! The wedding itself is a formal affair, in a suits-not-tuxes kind of way.</p>

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <h2>Will we be bombing and shredding?</h2>
                    <p>Yes! We hope everyone will get out on the mountain as much as possible. We’ll have group rate tickets, but we have to purchase ahead. If you are interested, please contact the Maid of Honor, Sara Petruska, at sarapetruska@yahoo.com before January 15th.</p>
