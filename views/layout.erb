                    <p>The wedding itself will be at the Ritz Carlton. Lodging and other gatherings will be in Northstar Village, which is connected to the Ritz by gondola and shuttle bus until 10 pm.</p>
                     
                    <p>Northstar Resort is about 45 minutes from Reno Airport, serviced by most major airlines. It is a 3 hour drive from San Francisco. **Winter driving in this area is intense. If you plan to drive at all, you will need either 4 wheel drive or tire chains, by law. Please don’t take this lightly!</p>
                     
                    <h2>Do I Have to Drive?</h2>
                    <p>Nope. We’ve tried to plan this weekend so that driving is not required. As long as you are staying in the Northstar Village Rooms & Lofts, you don’t have to drive! If you stay in other lodging within the resort (Gold Bend, Ski Trails, Aspen Grove, etc), free shuttles run within the resort from 8 am to 10 pm. Call a shuttle at 530.562.2257. Put it in your phone right now!</p>

                    <p>Make your reservations soon; space will fill up! Our group code (GB4RMW ) will get you a discount on all Northstar condos and houses. There’s a wide array of configurations with 0-4 bedrooms per unit, some with kitchens. Buddy up for a better rate!<p>

                    <p>For maximum accessibility, we recommend the centrally located Northstar Rooms and Lofts.</p>
                    <p>Other group rate lodging will be accessible by shuttle until 2am the night of the wedding and until 10 pm other nights. The Ski Trails Condos offer Ski In/Ski Out Access.</p>
                     
                    <h2>I’m Fancy Or Something. Are There Other Lodging Options?</h2>
                    <p>Well, look at you. You can stay at the Ritz and soak your feet in champagne every night. You will have access to the Village via gondola until 10 pm. Airbnb has some options within the resort; but likely our group rate is a better value. There are many other options throughout the Tahoe area, but of course, you’ll need a car for these. Feel free to poke around.</p>
