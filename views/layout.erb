                    <p>Northstar Resort is 45 minutes from Reno International Airport and a 3-4 hour drive from San Francisco. **Winter driving in this area is intense! Either 4 wheel drive or tire chains are required by law. Please don’t take this lightly!</p>

                    <p>The wedding itself will be at the Ritz Carlton Hotel. Lodging and other gatherings will be in Northstar Village, which is connected to the Ritz by gondola.</p>
                     
                    <h2>Do I Have to Drive?</h2>
                    <p>Nope. As long as you are staying in Northstar <span class="italics">Village</span>, you can get everywhere on foot or by gondola. Outside the village, free shuttles run within the resort from 8 am to 10 pm. Call one at 530.562.2257. Put it in your phone right now!</p>
                     
                    <h2>How Do I Get To And From the Airport?</h2>
                    <p>Taxis run between Reno Airport and Northstar 24 Hours. One way service is roughly $90 for up to 4 people, $10 each additional person.  Try Lakeshore Taxi at 530.544.3600 or Elite Tahoe Taxi at 530.580.8294. Advanced reservations are recommended, especially for groups.</p>

                    <p>A more affordable option, especially for singles, is North Lake Tahoe Express Shuttle. It’s a scheduled shuttle for $45 one way (or less, if you have more people). Advance reservations are required. Call 866.216.5222. Here are the times:</p>

                    <p>We have housing of all kinds, and a group rate for most of it. Don't delay; things will fill up! Most people will want to stay in the Village; for other locations, shuttles run until 10 pm.<p>

                    <p>The links below will let you see pics, but <span class="italics">please do not reserve online</span>! The system is confusing and will not always allow you to choose the Village. Read carefully below, then call 1.800.GO.NORTH and use group code GB4RMW. You may need to wait for a call back.</p>

                    <p>Many options have kitchens, living rooms and multiple bedrooms and baths. The best way to save is by buddying up.</p>

                    <p>Finally, the prices you will see on the website do not reflect our discount. The discounted rates are listed for you below (weeknight/weekend).</p>

                    <h2>Should I Pack Anything Special?</h2>
                    <p>Definitely, bring your snow gear, skis, boards, mittens and reindeer sleigh. Bring a bathing suit for the hot tub or pool. The wedding itself is a formal affair, in a suits-not-tuxes kind of way. The ceremony will be outside, so please bundle up!</p>

                    <h2>Will we be bombing and shredding?</h2>
                    <p>Yes! We hope everyone will get out on the mountain as much as possible. Info on group rate tickets and rentals</p>
